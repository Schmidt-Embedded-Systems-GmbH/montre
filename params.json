  "tagline": "A timed regular expression matcher over timed symbolic behaviors",
  "body": "## Use for\r\n* Pattern search/extraction over timed behaviors (analog signals, execution traces, music, etc.)\r\n* Runtime monitoring/verification of real-time systems\r\n* Feature extraction and dimensionality reduction before temporal pattern mining\r\n\r\n## Get Started\r\nFirst install Pure 0.64 and dependencies. For more details please refer to the original documents:\r\nhttps://bitbucket.org/purelang/pure-lang/wiki/GettingStarted\r\n```sh\r\nwget https://bitbucket.org/purelang/pure-lang/downloads/pure-0.64.tar.gz\r\ntar xfvz pure-0.64.tar.gz\r\ncd pure-0.64\r\n./configure --enable-release\r\nmake\r\nmake check\r\nsudo make install\r\n```\r\nThen install Montre as follows:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngit clone https://github.com/doganulus/montre\r\ncd montre\r\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./src/libmontre/\r\nmake\r\nsudo make install\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Tutorial\r\nWe have used Montre to find all sprints performed by a player in a real soccer match. See the tutorial [Finding Sprints](https://github.com/doganulus/montre/blob/master/demo/finding-sprints.ipynb).\r\n\r\n## About\r\nMontre has been developed by [Dogan Ulus](http://doganulus.com) at Verimag/Universite Grenoble Alpes as a part of his (ongoing) PhD thesis.\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgments\r\nThe development of Montre, in particular the theory behind, has benefited from the suggestions and contributions from Thomas Ferrere, Eugene Asarin, Oded Maler, Dejan Nickovic and Marius Bozga.\r\n",
