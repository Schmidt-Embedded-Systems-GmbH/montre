    "We present an example use of Montre on a data set obtained by tracking positions of players in a real soccer match. In this example, we find all sprints performed by a single player where a sprint is formally specified by a timed regular expression over speed and acceleration behaviors. The data are obtained by a computer vision algorithm with a frame rate of 10 Hz so we have a xy-coordinate for each player on the field at every 100 milliseconds. Therefore we use milliseconds as our base time unit for behaviors and expressions."

Clearly, there are no universal answers for these questions so we rely on the study] in the following. First, we partition speed and acceleration axes into four categories (near-zero, low, medium, and high), and we associate a letter for each category below. For example, a period of medium speed, denoted by r, means the speed value resides between 3.7 and 6 m/s during the period."
